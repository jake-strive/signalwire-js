'@signalwire/js': patch

Deprecated `getLayoutList` and `getMemberList` in favour of `getLayouts` and `getMembers` respectively. Other methods (`audioMute`, `audioUnmute`, `deaf`, `hideVideoMuted`, `removeMember`, `setInputSensitivity`, `setLayout`, `setMicrophoneVolume`, `setSpeakerVolume`, `showVideoMuted`, `undeaf`, `videoMute`, `videoUnmute`) that were previously returning `{ code: string, message: string }` also went through a signature change and are now returning `Promise<void>`
